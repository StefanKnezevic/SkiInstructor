                    <h3>Classes for children</h3>
                    <p>The recommended age for starting with lessons is 3+ years old. Kids primarily learn by imitating
                        the instructor.
                        Children start with exercises on a flat base, and then move onto gentle slopes. Since they are
                        younger they typically
                        require more animation, so the training is based on games etc. in order to capture their
                        attention and gain their
                        interest. With older children, focus shifts to working on technique and correcting errors. In
                        addition to ski knowledge,
                        children also master the rules of behavior on the ski slopes and the use of cable cars.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="child-1">
                    <h3>Classes for adults</h3>
                    <p>The verbal method of training is much more prevalent in training sessions for adults. Adult
                        beginners often experience
                        fear and require assurance and support from the instructor. The instructor must provide them
                        with safety with assistance
                        and a gradual transition to the next tasks. With more experienced skiers, focus is put on
                        technique correction, with
                        exercises being done to correct mistakes and then also learn new techniques.</p>
